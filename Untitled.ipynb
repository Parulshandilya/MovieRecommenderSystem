It exceeded our expectations in many respects. The rooms were large and comfortable, with many extra amenities. The breakfast was very extensive, with many fresh fruits, eggs, breads and even waffles.The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, especially with suggestions of places to see during our rather limited time in the city. (Highlights were the Columbia Center, the second tallest building on the west coast, with marvelous views of the surrounding area, and also the Pike Street Market.)We also appreciated the location, as it is within two blocks of the area of free bus transportation from early morning to late evening on all buses in the downtown area.

The opening to the dressing room/closet/vanity area was less than 23, located directly off of the entry area to the room. There were a total of nine lamps and wall fixtures, of which only 2 could be lighted.

It was a big football game weekend and the hotel was at full occupancy. The bed linens were said to be new, but the mattress and box springs were very worn and shabby. The color scheme of the draperies, upholstery and bedding was disconcerting.

(One negative, it was next to what appeared to be a storage area and the houskeeping staff tended to congrate outside my door but I got used to it) I balanced it by the fact that I could go right down the stairs to the whirlpool on the first floor without going thru the lobby .

Keep the subject line in mind when thinking about booking this hotel. I hope other people have had great experiences as Seattle is so Great but that was not my experience. I booked a non smoking room because, Yes, us difficult Californians don't like the smell of smoke. My room reaked of smoke. Obviously, the people who stayed there before probably smoked in the room every day. The manager, although understanding, said We can't control that, and we have no other room to give you. (Which was true in August in Seattle.) The next day, the electric on one wall went out and I was left with no reading lights. I was informed that there was nothing they could do about this until Monday but on Sunday the lights did come back on. Yes, they did give me a small discount but that was not the point. When I go to a city a don't want to have conflict regarding my room. The kids at the front desk were very nice but they didn't know what to do. Anyway, not all Best Westerns are bad but it really depends on the individual owner. If you have the money stay at the Westins as they offer a very consistent level of room and service.
